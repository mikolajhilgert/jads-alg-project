# JBP031-B-6 Data structures and Algorithms 2023 
The following assignment description was given as part of the Data Structures and Algorithms course as part of the JADS pre-master:

The municipal administration of Den Bosch wants to keep its streets clean by placing as
many garbage bins as possible on street intersections, particularly in the aftermath of the
carnival festivities. However, this would require the garbage collectors to make more stops
on their daily routes, which they are not thrilled about. To reach a compromise, the city
and the collectors have agreed that the city will place as many bins as possible, but only one
bin will be placed on adjacent intersections. The parties are satisfied with this solution,
and the city has already ordered the bins. However, the task of placing them in the city
has proven to be more challenging than expected. As an expert in Algorithms and Data
Structures, the city has enlisted your help to determine if it is feasible to place all the bins
in the city.
